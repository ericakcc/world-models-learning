## Key Paradigm Shifts

### 1. Anchor-Based → Anchor-Free (v1-v7 → v8+)
- v1-v7: Predefined anchor box shapes (need k-means tuning)
- v8+: Direct center + offset prediction (simpler, more generalizable)

### 2. Coupled → Decoupled Head (v1-v5 → v6+)
- Coupled: Single head for both classification and regression
- Decoupled: Separate branches (classification needs semantic features, regression needs spatial features)

### 3. CNN-Only → Attention Integration (v1-v11 → v12+)
- v1-v11: Pure CNN-based feature extraction
- v12: Attention-centric design with Area Attention (A2) module
- YOLO26: Further refinements for edge deployment

### 4. NMS-Required → NMS-Free (v1-v9 → v10, YOLO26)
- Traditional: Requires NMS post-processing (non-deterministic latency)
- NMS-free: End-to-end detection with consistent dual assignments (deterministic, deployment-friendly)
